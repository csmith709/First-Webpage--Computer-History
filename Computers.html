    <h3>In The Beginning ...</h3>
    <p><span class="firstcharacter">T</span>he history of computers starts out about 2000 years ago, with the birth of the <a href = "https://www.ecb.torontomu.ca/~elf/abacus/history.html" target="_blank">  abacus</a>.  When the beads on  the  abacus  are  moved  around,  according  to programmingrules  memorized  by  the  user,  all  regular arithmetic problems can be done.  In 1671, Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz invented a computer that was built  in  1694.  It  could  add,  and,  after  changing  some  things  around,  multiply.    About  a  century  later Thomas of Colmar  created  the  first  successful mechanical  calculator  that  could add,  subtract,  multiply, and divide.</p>

    <h3>Other Memorable Events ...</h3>

     <blockquote><ul>
     <li>In <span class="yearbold">1812</span>, Babbage realized that many long calculations were really a series of predictable actions that were constantly repeated. He began to design an automatic mechanical calculating machine, which he called a difference engine.</li> 
<br/>
     <li>Herman  Hollerith  and  James  Powers  made  a  step  towards  automated  computing  with  the development of punched cards. Reading errors were reduced dramatically, workflow increased, and stacks of punched cards could be used as memory of almost unlimited size. Formore than 50 years, punched card machines did most of the world's first business computing.</li>
<br/>
     <li>The start of World War II produced a large need for computer capacity.  In <span class="yearbold">1942</span>, John P. Eckert and John W. Mauchly decided to build a high -speed electronic computer to do the job. Known as <a href = "https://www.hp.com/ca-en/shop/offer.aspx?p=computer-history-all-about-the-eniac#" target="_blank">  ENIAC</a>, this machine could multiply two numbers at a rate of 300 per second.</li>
 <br/>
    <li>Early in the 50's two important engineering discoveries changed the image of the computer field -Magnetic  Core  Memoryand Transistor -Circuit  Elements.  These  technical  discoveries  quickly found their way into computers. Such computers were mostly found in large computer centers operated by industry, government, and private laboratories.</li>

    <li>In  the  <span class="yearbold">1960</span>'s,  efforts  to  design  and  develop  the  fastest  possible  computer  with  the  greatest capacity reached a turning point with the <a href = "https://dbpedia.org/page/IBM_7030_Stretch" target="_blank">Stretch computer</a> by IBM. Stretch was made with the fastest access time, and total capacity in the vicinity of 100,000,000 words.</li> 
<br/>
    <li>Many  companies,  some  new  to  the  computer  field,  introduced  programmable minicomputerssupplied with software packages in the <span class="yearbold">1970</span>’s. The "shrinking" trend continued with the introduction of personal computers (PC's), which are programmable machines small enough and inexpensive  enough to  be purchased  and  used  by  individuals.   Many  companies,  such as  Apple Computer and Radio Shack introduced very successful PCs in the <span class="yearbold">1970</span>’s.</li>
<br/>
    <li>By the late <span class="yearbold">1980</span>’s, some personal computers were run by microprocessors that, handling 32 bits of data at a time, could process about 4,000,000 instructions per second.</li>
<br/>
    <li>Computer  networking,  e-mail  and  the  Internet,  and  electronic  publishing  are  just  a  few  of  the applications that have grown in recent years. Computers continue to decrease in price, offering the promise that soon, “computers will reside in most homes, offices, and schools”.</li>

<h3>Computers accesibility and progress ...</h3>
<center><blockquote><ul>
<li>Unaccessable and only usable by geniuses (1950s)</li>
<li>Programmable by highly trained people (1960s - 1970s)</li>
<li>Useable by almost anyone willing to learn (1980s to current day)</li>
</ul></blockquote></center>

<h3>Added Features ...</h3>
<p>Included in this webpage are two added features.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Block</li>
        <li>Border Animation</li>
        <li>Scroll Block</li>
    </ol>
<center><div class="scrollblock"><p>The animated rainbow border block was added by having an additional div where background color, borders, border colors and animation were added. to the css page. The animation used is an @keyframes and is called steam, it gives the whipsy effect and the blur enhances it. This took a few tried figure out and the error I had been making the whole time was using '' in the content section instead of "". I then added the div section around my main header, resized it, and moved my main div down to give more of a divide. Lastly, I also added a scroll bar to this section using a .scroll and defining overflow to scroll and setting perameters.
